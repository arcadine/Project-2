# OpenClassrooms Web Development Project 2 by Diego Jorge
Project name: "Turn Mock-ups Into a Web Page with HTML & CSS"

https://arcadine.github.io/Project-2/

# Project Objectives:
"In this project, you will create a home page of a travel agency using HTML and CSS.
Your main mission will be to integrate their site's responsive interface. You'll be provided with Figma mockups for mobile, tablet and desktop, as well as images and a briefing note on the specificities of the project.
You'll be encouraged not to entirely trust Figma's code tool, but rather to write your own HTML and CSS code.
This will give you a deeper understanding of how code is structured and styled to meet design requirements.
Working on this project, you'll develop essential skills in responsive design, ensuring that the homepage works well on all devices and screen sizes."
